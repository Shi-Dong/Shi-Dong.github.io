= Abstract
I received my PhD from [https://www.stanford.edu Stanford University], and my doctoral research, advised by [https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr Prof. Benjamin Van Roy], develops a general and versatile framework to study reinforcement learning. Motivated by the passion for natural languages, I am now dedicated to understanding and unleashing the power of reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs). Prior to joining Google DeepMind, I was a Senior Researcher at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/knowledge-and-language/ Knowledge and Language Team, Microsoft], where I had the fortune to work with [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chezhu/ Chenguang Zhu]. Beyond research, I am a devout fan of British history and culture.\n
