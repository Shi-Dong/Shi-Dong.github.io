To use the `jemdoc` command, clone [this Github repo](https://github.com/Shi-Dong/jemdoc-python3.git) and run `python3 jemdoc.py` on the `.jemdoc` file.  A number of `SyntaxWarning`s may arise but they do not seem to pose problems.

If no `python` is found, follow [these instructions](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/704099#:~:text=Doing%20the%20following%20command) to create a soft link of `python3` as `python`.
